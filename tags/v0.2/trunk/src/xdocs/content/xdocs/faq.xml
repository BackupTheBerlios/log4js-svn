		<faq id="appender">
			<question>Why I have to set an Appender? What is an Appender?</question>
			<answer>
				<p>Appenders are special implementations for different logging 
					behaviours. In some cases you probably want to log to a 
					popup window, in other situations you want to sent the 
					client logs to the server to store them there. </p>
				<p>log4js has a very flexible for these cirumstances and allows 
					own implementations for this. These are the appenders.</p>
				<p>There are already some appenders available within log4js, 
					have also a look at the <a href="ext:log4js/apidocs">API 
					documentation</a>:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>AjaxAppender</li>
					<li>ConsoleAppender</li>
					<li>JSAlertAppender</li>
					<li>MetatagAppender</li>
					<li>FileAppender</li>
					<li>WindowsEventAppender</li>
					<li>MozConsoleAppender</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Probably you have also an appender, to share with the 
					comunitiy?</p>

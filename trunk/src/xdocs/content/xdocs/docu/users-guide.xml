            <title>Introduction</title>

            <p> <em>Log4js</em> is a very small but usefull JavaScript library 
                to log events in your scripts. Often it is not useful to use 
                <code>alert('debug message');</code> spreaded through your 
                code. On the other hand a debugger like venkman can help you 
                also only if you debug on your own computer and when you can 
                use FireFox as browser. </p>
            <p> But the most problems will occure if you publish your web 
                application. Probably you have first a team of testers which 
                tests your software, but they will not have experiences with 
                debugging JavaScript. </p>
            <p> <em>Log4js</em> will solve these problems and probably some 
                more. You simply add Log4js to your scripts and the library 
                loggs all your events like you configured. The installation and 
                configuration will be described in the next sections. </p>
            <p> Using <em>Log4js</em> you need not to modify your complete 
                scripts if you are going productive as you have if you use the 
                alert-dialogs. You just configure if you still need logs and 
                how they should be logged on productive system. Nothing more.

            <title>Download and Installation</title>
            <p> To use <em>Log4js</em> you have to download the library first 
                from the <a href="ext:log4js/downloads">download section</a> of 
                the project. The library is available in two different 
                archives. It is up to you, if you prefere zip archive or tar.gz 
                archive. The content is the same. </p>
            <note> Extract the archive to a directory of your choice, but 
                preserve the directory structure of the archive! </note>
            <p> After extracting the archive, you will find following directory 
                structure: </p>

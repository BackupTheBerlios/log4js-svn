VERSION 0.1.5
-Changed the way log levels are modeled to mirror Log4j conventions.  
-Change Log4js.LogLevel to Log4js.Level (Log4j has a LogLevel class and a Level class, LogLevel is actually part of the LogFactor5 3rd party package) to match Log4j naming conventions
-Created static objects representing each log level.
-Added OFF and ALL levels to mirror Log4j levels.
-Renamed Log4js.LogEntry to Log4js.LoggingEvent to mirror Log4j naming conventions.

VERSION 0.1.4
-Combined HtmlConsoleAppender and WindowAppender into a single appender since they are really the same thing (a console) just in different locations
-New appender is called ConsoleAppender, you indicate whether the console should run inline during construction (default is to launch in new window)

VERSION 0.1.3
-created an Log4js.LogEntry object to model a log entry, has category, level, and message properties, it has a method to return a formatted string representing the message (need to replace this with actual Layouts)
-logs entries stored in central log entry array
-appenders are notified of new log entries through event notificiation and use of Log4js.Event objects
-when a new log entry appears all appenders automatically notified.
-when log entries are cleared all appenders are notified and cleared.
-added HtmlConsoleAppender that writes log messages to a hidden "console" that can be toggled with "Alt-d" - thanks to Corey Johnson whose Lumberjack (http://gleepglop.com/javascripts/logger/) code was adapted for this appender

VERSION 0.1.2
-pulled LogLevel and Logger under a main "class" called Log4js, updated all documentation an test functions to reflect changes.
-changed version to 0.1.2 (not sure how version number should change?)
-fixed "clear" and "close" buttons on WindowAppender
-fixed scrolling issues in WindowAppender
-fixed IE javascript bug if user chooses "no" on ActiveX dialouge
-updated all tests and comments to reflect above changes
